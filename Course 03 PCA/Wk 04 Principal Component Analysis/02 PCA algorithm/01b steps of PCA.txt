1. Subtract the mean from the data and send it at zero to avoid numerical problems. 
2, Divide by the standard deviation to make the data unit-free. 
3. Compute the eigenvalues and eigen vectors of the data covariance matrix. 
4. We can project any data point onto the principal subspace that is spanned by the eigenvectors that belong to the largest eigenvalues.
