* Jacobian describes the gradient of multivariable system
* If you calculate it for a scalar valued multivariable function, you get a row vector pointing up the direction of greater slope

* Optimization - finding the input values to functions, which correspond to either a maximum or a minimum of a system
* Examples of mathematical optimization: 
1. the planning of routes through busy cities (transportation)
2. the scheduling of production in a factory (manufacturing)
3. a strategy for selecting stocks when trading (finance)
